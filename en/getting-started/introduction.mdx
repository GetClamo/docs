# What is Clamo?

Clamo is a SaaS platform specialized in managing labor legal cases for the Peruvian market. Designed for law firms, corporate legal departments, and companies with high volumes of labor litigation.

## The Problem

Labor case management in Peru presents unique challenges:

- **Manual tracking**: Lawyers must constantly check the CEJ (Electronic Justice Center) to detect movements in their cases.
- **Scattered information**: Case data is fragmented across multiple systems and physical documents.
- **Lack of visibility**: Legal managers don't have clear metrics on their case portfolio status.
- **Risk of missed deadlines**: Notifications and procedural deadlines can easily be missed.

## The Solution

Clamo automates and centralizes the entire lifecycle of a labor case:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automated Monitoring">
    Intelligent CEJ scraping that detects new movements, resolutions, and notifications in real-time.

  <Step title="AI Normalization">
    LLM processing to classify movements, identify procedural milestones, and extract key information from documents.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Centralized Management">
    Unified dashboard to visualize all cases, filter by status, risk, and procedural stage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Intelligent Assistants">
